# 1. If you are incrementing from 0 by 0.022, 
# how many increments can you do before you get a floating point error? 

# x = 0
# count = 13     # check different numbers here
# for i in range(count):
#     x += 0.022 # increment
#     print(x)      # check this value for floating point error


# 2. Automate the code from the previous problem. Suppose you are 
# just given an increment value. Write code that automatically
# determines how many times you can add increment to itself 
# until you start to get a floating point error.

# your code here

x=0
count=0
step=0.022
while (x==step*count):
    print(x)
    x+=step
    count+=1
print(count-1)

# n = 0.022
# N = 1
# x = n
# while x == n*N:
#     print(x)
#     x += n
#     N += 1
